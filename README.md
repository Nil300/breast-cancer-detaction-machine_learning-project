***Introduction***

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in today’s society.

***Recommended Screening Guidelines:***

**Mammography** The most important screening test for breast cancer is the mammogram. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. It can detect breast cancer up to two years before the tumor can be felt by you or your doctor.

**Women age 40–45 or older** who are at average risk of breast cancer should have a mammogram once a year.

**Women at high risk** should have yearly mammograms along with an MRI starting at age 30.

***Some Risk Factors for Breast Cancer***

**Age.** The chance of getting breast cancer increases as women age. Nearly 80 percent of breast cancers are found in women over the age of 50.

**Personal history of breast cancer.** A woman who has had breast cancer in one breast is at an increased risk of developing cancer in her other breast.

**Family history of breast cancer.** A woman has a higher risk of breast cancer if her mother, sister or daughter had breast cancer, especially at a young age (before 40). Having other relatives with breast cancer may also raise the risk.

**Genetic factors.** Women with certain genetic mutations, including changes to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, are at higher risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetime. Other gene changes may raise breast cancer risk as well.
